Insights

There are 12 Departure Stations and 32 Arrival Stations, making 65 routes in total. Among the 65 routes, Manchester Piccadilly to Liverpool Lime Street is the most popular route with 4,428 trips. However, the top generating route in terms of revenue is London Kings Cross to York with a total of £183,193 (3,922 trips) due to price differences in terms of distance. The recorded busiest Departure Station is Manchester Piccadilly and the busiest Arrival Destination is Birmingham New Street.

Based on the generated pattern from the records, it shows that peak travel time in the morning is between 6 am - 8 am, and in the afternoon is between 5 pm - 7 pm. It likely shows that most of the passengers during the peak hours are commuters going to work and returning home after their working hours.

There are a total of 31,653 trips recorded which make a total revenue of £741,921 but with a 5% refund which has a total of £38,702. Most of the tickets were solved in advance amounting to £309,274. The most preferred payment method of the passengers is through credit card. But in terms of bulk in sales, it shows that the standard ticket is the most sold ticket class with a revenue of £592,522 while the First class is £149,399.

Out of 31,653 recorded trips, 27,481 are on-time trips, while 1,880 are canceled and 2,292 are delayed trips. The month of March has the highest number of cancelled and delayed trips with a total of 1,137 trips. Among the reasons for unsuccessful trips, weather and signal failure have the highest number of affected trips.

Recommendations

Understanding the cause of delays can minimize the refund request by strategizing to collaborate with the maintenance team to ensure that signal failure will unlikely occur. Also, we can improve customer satisfaction if we can able to reduce this issue.

To boost the revenue, we can strategize some online sales which can also minimize the crowd that needs to pay via station. Also, special promotions or some loyalty rewards can make more revenue for the first class trip. By doing some marketing strategy online, we can give the commuters a better option to ease their travel experience which can greatly affect the overall revenue.
Recommendations:
Improving high Revenue Routes: By focusing on improving and marketing routes that generate the most revenue, such as London Kings Cross to York. Enhancing services and targeted promotions can attract more passengers and increase profitability.

Improving Infrastructure and Staffing: Addressing the causes of delays and cancellations, particularly on high-revenue routes. Enhancing infrastructure, increasing staff, and implementing plans for adverse weather conditions can improve service reliability.
